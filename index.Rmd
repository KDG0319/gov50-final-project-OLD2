## Project thoughts

Milestone #1 Ideas: 

I am interested in exploring data related to...

1. My first area of interest would be exploring the Latine population in the U.S and how they interact with higher education. In particular, I would be interested in exploring what types of institutions they attend, where, and other relating factors .

2. Another option I would be interested in, is the exploration of data relating to music popularity during different times of the year. I would like to look at types/genres of songs that gain popularity depending on the time of year.
